From Windows you'll need Putty and Putty SCP (PSCP).

1. Copy the code to an ELW B215 computer (c66.seng.uvic.ca ... c101.seng.uvic.ca)
  - Use PSCP from Windows cmd
  - pscp.exe c:\some\path\to\a\file.txt user@remote:/hom/user/some/path
  - Example: "C:\Program Files (x86)\PuTTY\pscp.exe" C:\git\seng440\main.c jeremyk@c101.seng.uvic.ca:/home/jeremyk/SENG440"

2. Compile
  - Open Putty (or some SSH client)
  - Connect to an ELW B215 computer
  - Example: /opt/arm/4.3.2/bin/arm-linux-gcc -static -o main.exe main.c

3. Connect to ARM machine and create a folder
  - ssh seng440.ece.uvic.ca
  - run "telnet arm" to connect to the arm-based machine, 
  - Four users (user1, user2, user3, user4). The password is the same as the course website password.
  - Create a folder of your own, e.g. "jeremyk"
  
3. Moving the executable to ARM
  - To exit telnet: 'Ctrl' + ']', then "quit"
  - navigate to the folder with the executable
  - Setup a network config file for the lftp command:
    - vi ~/.netrc
    - Set the file contents to: "machine arm login user3 password <password>"
  - Create an lftp script:
    - vi script.lftp
    - Set the file contents to: "open arm" "put -O <destFolderName> main.exe" "quit" (one command per line)
  - lftp -f script.lftp
  - ... this command takes awhile to execute

5. Run the executable
  - Re-connect to arm machine
  - cd <destFolderName>
  - run "chmod +wrx main.exe"
  - ./main.exe

Optional: Get the executable from the ELW B215 computer
  - Use PSCP from Windows cmd
  - pscp.exe user@remote:/home/user/some/file.txt c:\some\path\to\a\
  - Example: "C:\Program Files (x86)\PuTTY\pscp.exe" jeremyk@c101.seng.uvic.ca:/home/jeremyk/SENG440/main.exe C:\git\seng440\"
